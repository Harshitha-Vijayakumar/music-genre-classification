# music-genre-classification
Music genre classification using different network architectures which are trained on the GTZAN dataset.
The architectures used are:
1. A fully connected network with two hidden layers. 
2. The convolutional network. 
3. A convolutional network obtained by modifying 2nd architecture by adding a batch 
normalisation layer. 
4. The same architecture in the above 3, with the RMSProp optimiser.
